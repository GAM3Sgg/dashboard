# 🌙 Ramadan Noon Collaboration Campaign Plan
## Games+ Signup Incentives
**Prepared by:** Frieza (Copy, Ads & Conversion Specialist)  
**Campaign Partner:** Noon (Regional Shopping Platform)  
**Target Region:** Middle East  
**Timing:** Ramadan Period 2026

---

## Campaign Overview

**Core Strategy:** Leverage Ramadan's psychology of gifting, community, and spiritual reflection to drive Games+ signups through exclusive Noon discount rewards.

**Key Insight:** Ramadan is the Middle East's most gifting-oriented period. Gamers actively buy gaming accessories for themselves and gifting to friends/family. By pairing Games+ premium access with Noon shopping rewards, we create a win-win that feels like a blessing, not a sale.

---

## 1. BANNER DESIGN CONCEPTS & CREATIVE DIRECTION

### Color Psychology for Ramadan
- **Primary:** Deep emerald green (Islamic tradition, growth, prosperity)
- **Accent:** Gold/warm bronze (spirituality, premium gifting, luxury)
- **Secondary:** Soft white/cream (purity, peace, Ramadan lanterns)
- **Typography:** Clean, modern Arabic-friendly fonts; elegant spacing

---

### Concept A: "Blessings Within Reach"
**Angle:** Spiritual gifting meets gaming rewards  
**Visual Direction:** Lantern imagery + gaming controller blend  
**Copy Focus:** Ramadan as a time of giving to oneself

**Design Elements:**
- Ornate Ramadan lantern (top left) transitioning into gaming controller outline
- Gold gradient background
- Centered headline with both English + Arabic
- Discount code preview (Noon logo with amount)

**Why it works:** Connects spiritual giving (Ramadan tradition) with self-care (gaming). Elevates the offer beyond transactional.

---

### Concept B: "Double the Joy"
**Angle:** Stacking value (Games+ premium + shopping discount)  
**Visual Direction:** Split design showing both products  
**Copy Focus:** Getting more with less effort

**Design Elements:**
- Left side: Games+ icon with "Premium Access" callout
- Right side: Noon shopping bag with savings amount
- Center: Connecting arrow or "+" symbol
- Star burst or glow effect around both

**Why it works:** Shows immediate dual benefit. Visually emphasizes stack value. High-intent viewers see exactly what they get.

---

### Concept C: "Your Ramadan Companion"
**Angle:** Community & connection during Ramadan  
**Visual Direction:** Minimal, warm, human-centric  
**Copy Focus:** Sharing and playing together

**Design Elements:**
- Illustration of diverse hands/controllers in circle (gaming community)
- Soft background with subtle Ramadan crescent
- Warm terracotta/gold color scheme
- Friend-sharing emphasis in copy

**Why it works:** Ramadan is family/community-oriented. Positions Games+ as social, not isolating. Emotional resonance over transactional.

---

### Concept D: "Ramadan Rewards"
**Angle:** Limited-time scarcity + premium positioning  
**Visual Direction:** Clean, bold, countdown/urgency  
**Copy Focus:** Exclusive opportunity, acts fast

**Design Elements:**
- Bold "RAMADAN ONLY" banner (top)
- Large discount percentage or Noon amount
- "Limited Time" callout
- Gaming + shopping imagery minimal, focus on offer

**Why it works:** Drives FOMO. Ramadan-specific scarcity is psychologically powerful. "Limited" and "exclusive" trigger urgency and premium positioning.

---

### Concept E: "Level Up Your Ramadan"
**Angle:** Gaming terminology + personal growth  
**Visual Direction:** Modern, energetic, gamer-focused  
**Copy Focus:** Progress, achievement, unlocking benefits

**Design Elements:**
- Gaming achievement/trophy icon
- Progress bar or level-up visual
- Bright accent colors (emerald + gold)
- Gamer language ("Unlock," "Premium Tier," "Rewards")

**Why it works:** Speaks directly to gaming audience. Achievement psychology is powerful. Positions signup as leveling up their Ramadan.

---

**Recommended Banner Specs:**
- Desktop: 728x90, 300x250, 970x250
- Mobile: 320x50, 300x250, 320x480
- Static + animated versions for each (3-frame loop)
- Arabic text right-aligned; English left-aligned

---

## 2. BANNER COPY & CTAS OPTIMIZED FOR SIGNUP CONVERSION

### Primary Headlines (By Angle) — UPDATED FOR 4-WEEK ROTATING CODES

**Concept A - Blessings Within Reach:**
- "Your Blessing Unlocked: 4 Weeks of Premium Games+ + Noon Discounts"
- "Ramadan's Greatest Gift: Gaming Premium + Weekly Noon Rewards"
- "Give Yourself the Gift: Games+ + Exclusive Discounts Every Week"

**Concept B - Double the Joy (Now Enhanced: 4 Weeks):**
- "Get Premium Games+ + 4 Weeks of Noon Rewards"
- "4 Weeks of Gaming + Shopping Bliss This Ramadan"
- "Every Week, New Rewards: Premium Games+ + Noon"

**Concept C - Your Ramadan Companion:**
- "Play Together This Ramadan: Premium Games+ + Weekly Noon Codes"
- "Your 4-Week Gaming Companion: Premium Access + Discounts"
- "Ramadan Gaming with Community Rewards"

**Concept D - Ramadan Rewards (Scarcity Angle - EVEN STRONGER):**
- "⏰ Ramadan Only: 4 Exclusive Weekly Codes for Premium Members"
- "Limited 4 Weeks: Premium Games+ + New Noon Reward Every Week"
- "Each Week a New Deal: Premium + Rotating Noon Discounts"

**Concept E - Level Up Your Ramadan:**
- "Unlock Premium: Games+ + 4 Weeks of Exclusive Rewards"
- "Level Up 4 Times: Weekly Games+ Premium Benefits + Noon Codes"
- "Ramadan Achievement Unlocked: 4-Week Reward Path"

**KEY INSIGHT:** The 4-week rotating structure is actually STRONGER than a single discount because:
1. It's more generous (multiple categories, 4 chances to save)
2. It creates a SERIES (not a one-time offer) = longer engagement hook
3. Weekly variety appeals to different needs/occasions
4. Scarcity PER WEEK (not just per campaign) drives weekly urgency

---

### CTA Button Variations (By Urgency/Positioning) — UPDATED FOR 4-WEEK CODES

**High Urgency (for late-campaign, final weeks):**
- "Unlock 4 Weeks of Rewards" (emphasizes stack value)
- "Get Premium + Weekly Codes" (direct benefit stack)
- "Claim My Rewards (Limited Time)" (urgency + clarity)

**Standard (mid-campaign, baseline conversion focus):**
- "Sign Up for Games+ Premium" (clear action)
- "Get Premium + Weekly Discounts" (benefit focus, highlights rotation)
- "Join Premium Gaming Now" (community angle)

**Low-Friction (early campaign, awareness phase):**
- "See All 4 Weeks of Rewards" (exploratory, emphasizes value)
- "Learn About Our Premium Offer" (educational)
- "Start Gaming + Save" (combined benefit)

**Premium/Exclusive (for high-intent audiences):**
- "Claim Exclusive 4-Week Access" (premium positioning)
- "Unlock Ramadan Premium" (time-specific)
- "Get This Week's Code + More" (scarcity angle: start with current week's code)

**ROTATION PSYCHOLOGY:** "Get This Week's Code + More" is strongest because:
- "This Week's Code" = urgency (limited to 7 days)
- "+ More" = implies additional future benefits
- Creates instant value (code is available TODAY) + sustained value (more coming)

---

### Subheadline / Supporting Copy — UPDATED FOR 4-WEEK CODES

**Primary Offer Statement (2-3 versions):**
1. "Sign up to Games+ Premium and unlock 4 weeks of exclusive Noon discount codes. New code every week: gaming, home, lifestyle, and travel."
2. "Upgrade to Games+ Premium and get rotating Noon rewards throughout Ramadan. Week 1 code starts now—new categories each week."
3. "Games+ Premium + 4 exclusive Noon codes throughout Ramadan. 15-20% off gaming, home, fashion, and tech—one new code each week."

**Alternative (Emphasizes New User Advantage):**
- "Sign up to Games+ and start with Week 1 rewards: 15% off gaming accessories + exclusive codes for the next 3 weeks."

**Proof/Credibility (to go near CTA):**
- "✓ Verified by 50K+ gamers in the region"
- "✓ Official Noon partnership"
- "✓ New code every week through Ramadan"
- "✓ 15-20% off gaming, home, lifestyle, and tech"
- "✓ No hidden fees, all codes listed in your welcome email"

**Key Copy Principle:** The 4-week structure IS the value prop. Don't bury it—lead with it.

---

### Mobile CTA Optimization
- Button should be **44-48px height** minimum
- Text: 16-18px for readability
- Sticky bottom button on mobile (stays visible while scrolling)
- Secondary CTA: "Tell Me More" (leads to FAQ or landing page)

---

## 3. UTM TRACKING STRATEGY

### UTM Structure
```
base_url?utm_source=noon&utm_medium=[placement]&utm_campaign=ramadan_2026&utm_content=[creative_variant]&utm_term=[audience_segment]
```

### Parameter Naming Convention

**utm_source:** `noon` (partner name)

**utm_medium:** (placement type)
- `email` — Noon email to customers
- `in-app` — Noon app notification/banner
- `social` — Noon social channels (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter)
- `affiliate` — Noon affiliate/influencer network
- `display` — Programmatic/display ads running through Noon's network
- `search` — If running paid search (Google, Bing)
- `direct` — Direct links (QR codes, offline collateral)

**utm_campaign:** `ramadan_2026` (consistent across all channel variants)

**utm_content:** (creative identifier)
- `banner_concept_a_blessings`
- `banner_concept_b_double_joy`
- `banner_concept_c_community`
- `banner_concept_d_rewards`
- `banner_concept_e_levelup`
- `email_hero_v1` (for email campaigns)
- `social_reels_15s` (for social video)
- `influencer_post_[handle]` (for influencer content)

**utm_term:** (audience segment)

- `noon_premium` — Noon Plus subscribers
- `ramadan_enthusiasts` — Engaged during Ramadan season
- `new_audience` — New to both platforms
- `high_intent` — Showed interest in gaming/shopping

### Tracking URL Examples
```
games.gg/signup?utm_source=noon&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ramadan_2026&utm_content=email_hero_v1&utm_term=noon_premium

games.gg/signup?utm_source=noon&utm_medium=in-app&utm_campaign=ramadan_2026&utm_content=banner_concept_b_double_joy&utm_term=gamers_core

games.gg/signup?utm_source=noon&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ramadan_2026&utm_content=social_reels_15s&utm_term=new_audience
```

### Analytics Setup
- Create dashboard tracking **signups by utm_content** (which creative is converting best)
- Track **utm_medium performance** (which Noon channel drives best quality)
- Monitor **utm_term segments** (which audiences convert highest)
- Set up **funnel analysis:** utm_source → signup → first purchase/engagement

### Tracking Validation
- Test all URLs before launch
- Verify UTM parameters in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Event setup
- Track both **utm-tracked signups** and **attributed discount code usage** to correlate quality

---

## 4. DISCOUNT CODE STRATEGY

### Code Mechanics (4-Week Rolling Structure)

**Code Strategy: Weekly Rotating Codes**

Unlike a single discount, the actual offer is **4 unique codes over 4 weeks**, each tied to different product categories and incentive tiers. This creates sustained engagement + discovery.

**Code Structure:**

| Week | Dates | Code Name | Category | New Users | Repeat Users | Max Discount |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | Feb 18–24 | `RMDNREADY` | Electronics & Gaming Accessories | 15% off | 10% off | 100 AED / 50 AED |
| 2 | Feb 25–Mar 3 | `RMDNHOME` | TVs, Laptops, Toys & Games | 20% off | 15% off | 100 AED / 75 AED |
| 3 | Mar 4–10 | `RMDNSTYLE` | Watches, Fragrances, Eyewear | 20% off | 15% off | 100 AED / 75 AED |
| 4 | Mar 11–19 | `RMDNFINAL` | Phones, Accessories, Travel Gear | 15% off | 10% off | 100 AED / 50 AED |

**Key Mechanics:**
- Each code **valid only during its week** (not stacking, creates weekly check-ins)
- **New vs. repeat user tiers** (encourages first purchase, then repeat)
- **Category rotation** (Week 1: gaming-focused → Week 2: broader home/gaming → Week 3: lifestyle → Week 4: mobile/travel)
- **Percentage + cap structure** (e.g., "15% off up to 100 AED" = feels more generous than absolute value)

**Why This Works Psychologically:**
1. **Zeigarnik Effect:** Open loop every week ("What's next week's code?") keeps users engaged
2. **Goal-Gradient:** 4-week journey feels achievable; users check each week
3. **Variety Drives Discovery:** Different categories appeal to different occasions/moods in Ramadan
4. **New vs. Repeat Incentive:** Reverse funnel—first discount is high-value (acquisition), repeat discounts lower but still generous (retention)
5. **Scarcity (Weekly):** Each code is only valid 7 days, creating urgency to use it

**Valid On:**
- Exact categories per week (as per Noon partnership)
- NOT stackable across weeks (one code per week)
- NOT combinable with other promotions (exclusive)

**Validity Period:**
- Each code valid **only during its assigned week**
- Post-signup email lists all 4 codes upfront (transparency + planning)
- Users can "save" email and reference it throughout Ramadan

---

### Redemption Flow (User Experience)

**At Games+ Signup:**
1. User fills signup form (email, password, optional: name)

- Instruction: "Save this email. Use each code during its active week on noon.com"
- Secondary CTA: "Explore trending games on GAMES.GG"
- Closing: "Ramadan Kareem!" (matches tone from provided email)

**In-App (Games+ Dashboard):**

  - Shows next 3 weeks in a preview strip
  - Category icon + discount amount clearly visible
  - "Copy Code" button (easy one-tap)

  - Discount shown: "15% off (up to 100 AED)"

### Brand Positioning & Messaging — ALIGNED WITH ACTUAL EMAIL TONE

**Games+ Messaging (to Games+ audience):**
- "We partnered with Noon to reward your loyalty throughout Ramadan"
- "Exclusive 4-week code series: gaming accessories, tech, lifestyle, and travel"
- "Discover your next favorite game + enjoy savings on gear you actually want"
- "Ramadan Kareem—here's our gift to you" (matches provided email tone)

**Noon Messaging (to Noon audience):**
- "Games+ members unlock weekly Noon discounts this Ramadan"
- "Sign up for premium gaming + enjoy 15-20% off every week"
- "New category every week: gaming gear, home tech, style, and travel"

**Joint Messaging (in co-branded communications):**
- "Games.gg + Noon: 4 Weeks of Rewards This Ramadan"
- "Premium Gaming + Weekly Exclusive Codes"
- "Ramadan Exclusive: Gaming Premium + Rotating Noon Discounts"

**Tone Notes (from provided email):**
- **Celebratory:** "Four weeks of discount codes on the stuff that you actually care about"
- **Inclusive:** "Ramadan Kareem" closing + community language
- **Action-oriented:** "Go explore what's trending on GAMES.GG"
- **Clear + Direct:** Lists codes upfront, no mystery
- **Gaming-First:** "Discover your next favorite game across every platform"

**Messaging Hierarchy:**
1. Primary: 4 weeks of exclusive codes (NEW each week)
2. Secondary: Rotating categories (gaming → home → style → travel)
3. Tertiary: New vs. repeat user incentives (builds retention narrative)

---

### Code Tracking & Attribution

**Track:**
- Code generation (how many codes issued via signup)
- Code redemption rate (% of codes actually used on Noon)
- Average order value when code redeemed
- Time to redemption (how quickly after signup)

**Expected Benchmarks:**
- Code redemption: 25-40% of issued codes redeemed (strong for multi-step redemption)
- Time to redemption: 50% redeemed within 3 days of signup
- ROAS: If discount cost = 75 AED, target min 3x Noon AOV to justify

## 8. CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Banner Sizing & Placement Strategy

**Desktop Banners:**
- **728x90 (Leaderboard):** Best for above-fold placements on partner sites
  - High visibility but smaller font; test 2-3 word headlines
- **300x250 (Medium Rectangle):** Sidebar or mid-content
  - High standard conversion rate; good for social proof
- **970x250 (Billboard):** Premium above-fold placement
  - Most visibility; best for video or animated content

**Mobile Banners:**
- **320x50 (Mobile Banner):** Sticky top or bottom bar
  - Minimum but persistent presence
  - Test: Sticky bottom > sticky top for games audience
- **300x250 (Medium Rectangle):** Center mobile placement
  - Good for full-screen takeovers on Noon app
- **320x480 (Full-width Mobile):** App interstitial
  - High-impact but high friction; use sparingly

**Placement Psychology:**
- **Above fold:** Higher CTR but higher bounces (test trade-off)
- **Sticky top:** Stays visible; test frequency capping (dismiss after 5 sec auto-minimizes)
- **Sticky bottom:** Less aggressive; ideal for mobile gaming (avoids interrupt during gameplay)
- **Scroll-triggered:** Show after 30-50% page scroll (indicates engagement)

---

### Color Psychology & Visual Hierarchy

**Ramadan Color Triggers:**
- **Emerald Green:** Islamic tradition, prosperity, community
- **Gold/Warm Bronze:** Spirituality, gifting, luxury (premium positioning)
- **White/Cream:** Purity, peace, Ramadan lanterns
- **Deep Blue:** Trust, stability (secondary, if needed)

**CTA Button Optimization:**
- **Color:** Gold or bright emerald (high contrast against background)
- **Size:** 44-48px height (mobile); 36-40px on desktop
- **Text:** White or cream text on colored button
- **Animation:** Subtle pulse or glow effect (draws attention, doesn't distract)

**Contrast Ratio:**
- Ensure **WCAG AA compliance** (4.5:1 text-to-background)
- Test with color-blind audience; avoid red-green combos

**Visual Hierarchy Order:**
1. Headline (largest, first attention)
2. Offer (Noon discount amount + Games+ benefit)
3. CTA button (prominent color, clear action)
4. Proof/trust elements (small text, high authority)
5. Close button (visible but not emphasized)

---

### Copywriting for Conversion

**Headline Principles:**
- **Specificity over vagueness:** "Get 75 AED Noon Discount" > "Save Now"
- **Benefit over feature:** "Play Premium Games + Save on Gear" > "Games+ Premium Signup"
- **Action over passive:** "Unlock Your Ramadan Rewards" > "Ramadan Offers Available"
- **First-person when possible:** "Get My Premium Access" > "Get Premium Access"

**CTA Button Text Formula:** [Action Verb] + [What They Get] + [When/Qualifier]
- ✓ "Unlock Premium + Rewards"
- ✓ "Claim My Noon Discount"
- ✓ "Get Premium Today"
- ✗ "Click Here"
- ✗ "Learn More"
- ✗ "Submit"

**Copy Length:**
- Headline: 4-8 words (desktop), 3-5 words (mobile)
- Subheadline: 10-15 words max
- Button text: 2-4 words
- Test longer CTAs on high-intent audiences (direct traffic); shorter on cold audiences (ads)

---

### Form Friction Reduction

**Signup Form Fields (Optimized for Conversion):**

**Minimum (Highest Conversion):**
- Email
- Password (with show/hide toggle)

**Standard (Good Balance):**
- Email
- Password
- First name

**Enhanced (If behavioral data needed):**
- Email
- Password
- First name
- Gaming preference (optional, progressive)
- Country (auto-detect if possible)

**Do NOT ask at signup:**
- Payment method (they're not paying yet)
- Gaming skill level (collect in onboarding)
- Purchase intent (collect post-signup)

**Form Optimization Details:**
- **Email field:** Inline validation, check for typos (gmial → gmail)
- **Password toggle:** Show/hide eye icon on all password fields
- **Submit button:** Full-width on mobile; 44px+ height
- **Progress indicator:** Show "Step 1 of 2" if multi-step
- **Autofill support:** Use proper input types (`type="email"`, `type="password"`)

---

### Mobile Optimization

**Mobile-Specific Conversions:**
- **Sticky CTA button:** Keep primary CTA visible while scrolling
- **One-column layout:** Stack all elements vertically
- **Touch targets:** Minimum 44x44px for all clickable elements
- **Keyboard type:** `type="email"` for email field (shows @ on mobile keyboard)
- **Form auto-complete:** Support browser autofill for email + password

**Mobile Banner Testing:**
- Test: Full-width sticky bottom > sticky top
- Gaming audience preference: Bottom (doesn't block game action)
- Test: Static banner > animated (animation can distract from gaming)

**Expected Mobile Conversion Lift:**
- Proper mobile optimization: +25-40% mobile conversion rate
- Sticky CTA alone: +10-15% completion
- 1-field reduction: +5-10% completion

---

### Post-Click Landing Page Optimization

**Message Match (Ad → Landing Page Coherence):**
- If ad says "75 AED discount," landing page headline should echo it
- If ad emphasizes Ramadan exclusivity, LP hero should reinforce timeline
- Color scheme should match ad for visual continuity

**Hero Section CRO:**
- Headline should answer: "What do I get?"
- Subheadline should answer: "Why now?"
- Image should show the benefit (gaming + shopping), not just products

**Social Proof Placement:**
- Place near form (builds trust before committing)
- Show "50K+ gamers signed up" or "Noon's #1 partner this Ramadan"
- Testimonial: "Best Ramadan offer I've seen" — [Customer name]

**FAQ Section:**
- Title: "Quick Questions?"
- Top 4-5 FAQs:
  - "When does my code expire?"
  - "What can I buy with my discount?"
  - "How many times can I use the code?"
  - "Is there a credit card required?"
  - "How do I access Games+ Premium?"

**Form Placement:**
- Above fold or inline (don't require scroll to form)
- Right column on desktop (users scan left-to-right, expect form right)
- After value prop + social proof on mobile

---

### Analytics & Conversion Tracking

**Events to Track:**
- `banner_impression` — Banner viewed
- `banner_click` — User clicked banner → landed on LP or signup
- `signup_started` — User began filling form
- `signup_completed` — Form submitted successfully
- `code_generated` — Discount code issued
- `code_displayed` — User saw code (thank you page)
- `code_copied` — User copied code to clipboard
- `code_redeemed` — Code used on Noon

**Funnel Analysis:**
```
1000 impressions
  → 80 clicks (8% CTR - baseline)
  → 60 LP visits (75% landed, 25% bounced)
  → 30 signup starts (50% form abandonment)
  → 20 signups completed (67% form completion)
  → 8 codes redeemed on Noon (40% code usage)
```

**Benchmark Targets:**
- Banner CTR: 5-10% (games audience typically high engagement)
- Signup completion rate: 50-70% (minimal form)
- Code redemption: 30-50% (multi-step process)
- Overall signup → code redemption: 25-35%

|-----|----------|--------|---------|
| **Signup Volume** | — | 10,000+ | 15,000+ |
| **Signup Conversion Rate** | 2-3% (cold) | 5-7% | 10%+ |

---

### Secondary KPIs (Health Metrics) — UPDATED FOR 4-WEEK STRUCTURE

| Metric | Expected | Implication |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Banner CTR** | 6-10% | Higher engagement due to "4-week" appeal |
| **Landing Page Bounce Rate** | <35% | Message match quality |
| **Form Start Rate** | 75%+ | Interest level (4-week value is sticky) |
| **Form Completion Rate** | 65-80% | Form friction level |
| **Welcome Email Open Rate** | 35-45%+ | High anticipation (it contains all 4 codes!) |
| **Welcome Email Click Rate** | 15%+ | Dual CTAs (Noon + Games) drive higher clicks |
| **Time to First Code Redemption** | Median 2-3 days | Urgency higher with limited weekly window |

| **Week 3 Code Redemption Rate** | 30-35% | Decline continues (some fatigue, natural attrition) |
| **Week 4 Code Redemption Rate** | 25-30% | Final push; users either committed or churned |
| **Weekly Reminder Email CTR** | 10-15% | High because code is NEW each week |

---

### Segmented Benchmarks

**By Traffic Source:**
- **Noon email:** Highest quality (existing customers) — expect 6-8% signup rate
- **Noon in-app:** High intent — expect 5-7% signup rate
- **Noon social:** Lower intent — expect 2-4% signup rate
- **Paid ads (programmatic):** Cold traffic — expect 2-3% signup rate

**By Audience Segment:**
- **Noon Plus subscribers:** Highest redemption (60%+) — they spend more, will use multiple codes
- **New Noon users:** Medium redemption (40%+) — building habits, attracted to "new user" higher discounts (15-20%)
- **Core gamers (Games.gg existing):** High engagement (high CTR), but many already premium — target non-premium segment
- **New-to-both:** Highest signup quality (high potential, Week 1 code drives trial)
- **Repeat Noon users:** Higher multi-week adoption (50%+) — familiar with platform, hunt codes weekly
- **First-time Noon users:** Lower multi-week adoption (30%+) — may drop after Week 1-2

**By Creative Variant (with 4-Week Context):**
- **Concept A (Blessings Within Reach):** Emotional resonance + "4 weeks" emphasizes generosity (target: +25% vs baseline)
- **Concept B (Double the Joy - Now 4x):** Clear value stack, emphasizes FOUR separate rewards (target: baseline +30%)
- **Concept C (Your Ramadan Companion):** "Companion for 4 weeks" repositioning; community angle sustained (target: baseline +10%)
- **Concept D (Ramadan Rewards - Weekly):** Scarcity per WEEK creates repeated urgency (target: +35% in Week 1, +25% in Week 4)
- **Concept E (Level Up):** "4-week achievement path" gamification strong; high engagement from core gamers (target: +35% from gamer segment)

**Predicted Winner:** Concept B or D (clear value stack + weekly scarcity combined = highest conversion)

---

### Attribution & Incrementality

**Track:**
- Signups WITH UTM `utm_source=noon` vs. organic signups
- Are Noon-sourced signups incremental or cannibalizing existing traffic?
- Revenue impact: Do Noon-sourced signups spend more/less than baseline?

**Method:**
- Create holdout group (10% of Noon traffic, no campaign exposure)
- Compare signup/retention rates with vs. without campaign
- Estimate **true incremental lift** (not just attribution)

## 📊 Psychology Deep-Dive: Why 4-Week Rotating Codes Work Better Than Single Offer

### The Psychological Edge

**1. Zeigarnik Effect (Unfinished Tasks)**
- Traditional model: Single code, one-time offer → "done"
- Rotating model: 4 codes, 4 weeks → Users have 3 unfinished loops
- **Impact:** Users check email, check app, anticipate next week's code
- **Engagement:** Creates weekly touchpoints without extra marketing effort

**2. Temporal Motivation (Deadline Effect)**
- Single code valid "until end of Ramadan" = abstract deadline (30+ days away)
- Weekly codes valid "7 days only" = concrete, immediate deadline
- **Impact:** Week 1 code feels urgent (use it THIS WEEK). Week 4 code feels urgent (LAST WEEK).
- **Result:** Higher redemption per code despite lower per-code discount

**3. Variety Reduction (Choice Paradox)**
- "How should I use my 75 AED discount?" = paralyzing choice
- "This week: Gaming Accessories (15% off). Next week: Home & Laptops (20% off)" = clear, sequential choices
- **Impact:** Users shop when category aligns with their needs/mood
- **Result:** Higher AOV (targeted shopping) + lower choice paralysis

**4. Habit Formation (Variable Rewards)**
- Fixed reward (single code) = less habit-forming
- Variable rewards (rotating categories) = slot-machine psychology (powerful)
- **Impact:** Users develop "check my Games+ app every Monday" habit
- **Bonus:** This drives Games+ app engagement beyond the discount

**5. Reciprocity Amplification**
- Single discount = "you gave me something"
- Four discounts = "you keep giving me things" (stronger reciprocal obligation)
- **Impact:** Users feel more grateful, more likely to refer, more loyal to brand

**6. FOMO Compounding (Fear of Missing Out)**
- Single FOMO window = 30 days (weak, everyone knows deadline)
- Four FOMO windows = every week feels like last chance (strong, creates recurring urgency)
- **Impact:** Week 3's code triggers "I've missed Week 1 and 2, can't miss Week 3"

### The Business Edge

**Retention Multiplier:**
- Single code: Signup → redeem → churn
- Four codes: Signup → redeem Week 1 → return for Week 2 → return for Week 3 → return for Week 4 → possible churn
- **Expected multi-code adoption: 30-50% use 2+ codes, 15-25% use 3+ codes, 5-10% use all 4**

**Spend Multiplier:**
- Single use: One Noon order, one redemption event
- Four codes: Four separate shopping trips (if each appeals to different need)
- **Expected total spend: 600-1000 AED/user vs 200-300 AED single-code campaign**

**Data Advantage:**
- Single code: "User bought when they had 75 AED discount"
- Four codes: "User buys gaming in Week 1, home tech in Week 2, style in Week 3" → Rich behavioral data for personalization

### Banner Messaging Implication

The 4-week rotating structure should be **front and center** in all messaging:
- NOT: "Get a Noon discount"
- YES: "Unlock 4 weeks of rotating codes"
- Emphasize FOUR, not one
- Emphasize WEEKLY, not just at signup
