**Status:** ✅ Ready for Stakeholder Alignment

---

## Campaign At a Glance

**Offer:** Games+ Premium signup unlocks 4 weeks of exclusive Noon discount codes

## The Secret Sauce: 4-Week Rotating Codes

Instead of a single "Get 75 AED discount," the actual offer is **4 different codes over 4 weeks:**

| Week | Code | Category | New Users | Repeat Users |
|------|------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | RMDNREADY | Gaming & Electronics | 15% off | 10% off |
| 2 | RMDNHOME | Laptops, TVs, Games | 20% off | 15% off |
| 3 | RMDNSTYLE | Watches, Fragrances | 20% off | 15% off |
| 4 | RMDNFINAL | Phones, Accessories | 15% off | 10% off |

**Why this works:**
- 4 chances to redeem (vs 1) = higher redemption rates
- Weekly deadlines create **recurring urgency** (not just end-of-Ramadan pressure)
- Different categories appeal to different needs (gaming → home → style → travel)
- Psychological habit-forming (users check app weekly for new code)

## Key Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Stretch |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Signups** | 10,000+ | 15,000+ |
| **Signup Conversion Rate** | 5-7% | 10%+ |
| **Code Redemption Rate** | 50-70% | 80%+ |
| **Multi-Week Adoption** | 30%+ use 2+ codes | 50%+ use 3+ codes |
| **Total Spend Per User** | 600-1000 AED | 1200+ AED |
| **ROAS** | 2.5:1+ | 4:1+ |

## Psychology: Why This Campaign Works

**Zeigarnik Effect:** Users have 3 "open loops" (codes 2, 3, 4 coming) = keeps them engaged  
**Recurring Urgency:** New deadline every week (vs single 30-day deadline) = higher redemption  
**Variable Rewards:** Rotating categories = more habit-forming than fixed offer  
**Reciprocity:** Four gifts feel more generous than one = higher loyalty  
**Commitment:** Users who use Week 1 code are psychologically primed to return Week 2+

## Questions for Stakeholder Alignment

When presenting to Noon, be ready to answer:

1. **"How do we ensure people use all 4 codes?"**  
   → Weekly reminders + in-app notifications + clear categories per week

2. **"What if redemption drops by Week 4?"**  
   → Expected (natural attrition), but multi-week adoption goal is 30%+ use 2+ codes

3. **"Can codes be stacked?"**  
   → No (exclusive), one per week (prevents gaming the system)

4. **"How much will this cost us?"**  
   → Varies by redemption rate + AOV, but structured as: discount cost ÷ AOV ≈ 2.5:1+ ROAS

5. **"Why 4 weeks instead of one big discount?"**  
   → Psychology: recurring engagement > single transaction. Higher total spend, higher retention, better data.
