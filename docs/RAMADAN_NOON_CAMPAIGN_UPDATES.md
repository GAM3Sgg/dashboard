# 🔄 Campaign Update: 4-Week Rotating Codes Strategy

**Updated:** February 24, 2026  
**Prepared by:** Frieza (Copy, Ads & Conversion Specialist)

---

## Executive Summary

The actual signup email revealed a **4-week rotating code structure** that's **significantly more powerful** than the single-discount model in my initial plan. This update incorporates the real offer mechanics and aligns all messaging with the provided email copy.

### What Changed

**Original Plan:**
- Single discount code (75 AED or 15-20% off)
- Valid throughout entire Ramadan
- One redemption opportunity per user

**Actual Offer (From Email):**
- **4 rotating weekly codes** (RMDNREADY, RMDNHOME, RMDNSTYLE, RMDNFINAL)
- **Category-specific rewards** (Gaming Week 1 → Home Week 2 → Style Week 3 → Travel Week 4)
- **Tiered discounts** (New users get higher % off with higher caps; repeat users get lower)
- **Weekly deadlines** (each code valid only 7 days)

---

## Why This Is Better

### 1. **Sustained Engagement vs One-Time Offer**
- Original: Signup → get code → use immediately → churn
- New: Signup → use Week 1 → anticipate Week 2 → return for Week 2 → anticipate Week 3 → etc.
- **Psychological mechanism:** Zeigarnik effect (unfinished tasks keep people engaged)

### 2. **Higher Redemption Rates**
- Original target: 35-40% redemption
- New target: 50-70%+ redemption (4 chances to shop instead of 1)
- **Reason:** Weekly deadlines create recurring urgency vs single 30-day window

### 3. **Higher Total Spend Per User**
- Original target: 200-300 AED (single Noon order)
- New target: 600-1000 AED (4 separate shopping trips)
- **Reason:** Different week = different need/mood = encourages multiple purchases

### 4. **Better Retention & Multi-Week Adoption**
- Track users who return for Week 2, Week 3, Week 4 codes
- Expected: 30-50% use 2+ codes, 15-25% use 3+ codes
- **Benefit:** Identifies highly-engaged users for post-Ramadan retention

### 5. **Rich Behavioral Data**
- Single code: "User made a purchase with discount"
- Four codes: "User bought gaming accessories Week 1, home tech Week 2, style Week 3" → Detailed preference mapping

### 6. **Psychological Hooks**
- **Variable rewards:** Rotating categories = more habit-forming than fixed reward
- **Recurring FOMO:** New deadline every week (stronger than single deadline)
- **Reciprocity amplification:** Four gifts feel more generous than one
- **Commitment & consistency:** Users who use Week 1 code are psychologically committed to return for Week 2

## Code Structure Details

### The Four Codes (From Actual Email)

| Week | Dates | Code | Category | New Users | Repeat Users |
|------|-------|------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | Feb 18–24 | RMDNREADY | Electronics & Gaming | 15% off (up to 100 AED) | 10% off (up to 50 AED) |
| 2 | Feb 25–Mar 3 | RMDNHOME | TVs, Laptops, Games | 20% off (up to 100 AED) | 15% off (up to 75 AED) |

### New vs. Repeat Mechanics

- **Repeat Noon users** get lower % off (10-15%) but still substantial
- Creates natural funnel: acquire new Noon customers via gaming audience

## Email Copy Alignment

### Welcome Email (THE CRITICAL EMAIL)

The provided signup email is perfect for conversion because it:
- ✅ Lists all 4 codes upfront (transparency, no surprises)
- ✅ Shows exact categories for each week (helps users plan)
- ✅ Distinguishes new vs. repeat user discounts (addresses both segments)
- ✅ Celebratory tone ("Ramadan Kareem")
- ✅ Action-oriented ("Go explore trending games")
- ✅ Clear instruction ("Save this email and use each code during its active window")

**Tone to match in all banner/social copy:**
```
"You signed up through our Ramadan campaign with noon — 
so here's what you unlocked. Four weeks of discount codes 
on the stuff that you actually care about:"
```

---

## Updated KPI Targets

## Updated Analytics & Tracking

### New Metrics to Track

1. **Per-Code Redemption Rate** (not just total)
   - % of signups who redeemed RMDNREADY
   - % of RMDNREADY users who redeemed RMDNHOME
   - % of RMDNHOME users who redeemed RMDNSTYLE
   - % of RMDNSTYLE users who redeemed RMDNFINAL
   - **Reveals:** Where engagement drops (Week 2 retention is critical)

2. **Multi-Code Adoption** (segment analysis)
   - % using 1+ codes
   - % using 2+ codes
   - % using 3+ codes
   - % using all 4 codes
   - **Reveals:** Which users are most engaged (target for post-Ramadan retention)

3. **Category Performance** (what sells best when)
   - Week 1 Gaming: Highest redemption? (test hypothesis)
   - Week 2 Home/Laptops: Highest AOV?
   - Week 3 Style: Lower redemption (lifestyle vs utility)?
   - Week 4 Travel: Seasonal appeal?

4. **Welcome Email Performance** (the critical email)
   - Open rate (target 35-45%+)
   - Click rate (target 15%+)
   - Time to first click (measures urgency)
   - Dual CTA performance (Games.gg vs Noon)

### Dashboard Setup
- Create **Weekly Code Redemption Dashboard** (shows real-time usage)
- Create **Multi-Week Adoption Funnel** (shows retention cohorts)
- Create **Category Performance Table** (shows which weeks drive revenue)

## Psychology: Why Weekly Codes Are Genius

### Zeigarnik Effect (Unfinished Tasks)
Users have 3 "open loops" (Weeks 2, 3, 4 codes coming). Open loops create mental tension that drives engagement.
- User checks email: "Is next week's code announced yet?"
- User opens app: "Let me check the rewards calendar"
- User returns to Games.gg: Stays engaged longer

### Temporal Motivation (Deadline Effect)
- Single deadline (30+ days): Abstract, easy to procrastinate
- Weekly deadlines (7 days each): Concrete, create recurring urgency
- Psychology: "Week 1 code expires Friday → better use it soon"

### Variable Rewards (Slot Machine Psychology)
- Fixed reward: "I know what I'm getting"
- Rotating categories: "What's next week's category?" (more dopamine-triggering)
- Result: Habit formation (users develop "check Games+ app weekly" habit)

### Reciprocity Amplification
- One gift: "You gave me something"
- Four gifts: "You keep giving me things" (stronger obligation to repay)
- Result: Higher referral rate, higher loyalty
