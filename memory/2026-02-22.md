## Setup
- Agent name: Vegeta
- Updated IDENTITY.md

## API Keys
- LarryBrain API key stored in TOOLS.md

## Config Optimization
- Heartbeat model changed from Sonnet (default/expensive) to Haiku (cheap)
- Heartbeat interval changed from 30m to 55m (aligns with 1h cache TTL to avoid re-caching)
- Context pruning TTL increased from 1h to 6h (reduces re-processing)
- Added keepLastAssistants: 3 (preserves recent conversation continuity)
- Compaction mode changed from "safeguard" to "default" with memoryFlush enabled
- Memory flush triggers at 40k tokens, distills session to daily memory files
- Added Haiku as fallback model (graceful degradation if Sonnet rate-limited)
- Reduced maxConcurrent agents from 4 to 3, subagents from 8 to 4 (prevents quota spikes)
- Added logging.redactSensitive: "tools" (protects API keys in logs)
- Cleaned up old haiku model entries (3-5-haiku, 3-haiku) replaced with haiku-4-5
- Created MEMORY.md for long-term memory across sessions
